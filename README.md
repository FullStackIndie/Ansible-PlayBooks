# Ansible Playbooks
## Playbooks for setting up Ubuntu

This repo provides different playbooks and workflows for setting up a secure ubuntu server.
It comes with playbooks for popular services like **docker, git, and nginx and certbot**

Most playbooks are specific to my workflow and .Net apps but feel free to take inspiration from them
